# üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup Guide for Sauna Cult Booking

This guide will walk you through setting up a database to make your Sauna Cult booking system fully functional.

## üöÄ **Quick Setup (5 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Create a Database**

**Option A: Vercel Postgres (Recommended)**
1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click on your "sauna-cult-booking" project
3. Go to the "Storage" tab
4. Click "Create Database" ‚Üí "Postgres"
5. Name it "sauna-cult-db"
6. Choose the "Hobby" plan (free)
7. Copy the connection string (starts with `postgresql://`)

**Option B: Supabase (Alternative)**
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Database
4. Copy the connection string

**Option C: Railway (Another Option)**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Create a new project
3. Add a PostgreSQL database
4. Copy the connection string

### **Step 2: Add Environment Variables to Vercel**

1. In your Vercel project dashboard
2. Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Environment Variables"
3. Add these variables:

```
DATABASE_URL = your_postgres_connection_string_here
JWT_SECRET = your-random-secret-key-here-make-it-long-and-random
ADMIN_EMAIL = admin@saunacult.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD = admin123
```

**Important:** Make sure to replace `your_postgres_connection_string_here` with your actual database URL!

### **Step 3: Deploy the Updated Code**

The code is already updated with full database functionality. Just push to GitHub and Vercel will automatically deploy:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add full database functionality"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 4: Set Up the Database Schema**

After deployment, you need to run the database setup. You can do this by:

1. **Option A: Using Vercel CLI (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   npx vercel env pull .env.local
   npx prisma db push
   npx prisma db seed
   ```

2. **Option B: Using Vercel's Terminal**
   - Go to your Vercel project dashboard
   - Go to "Functions" tab
   - Click on any function
   - Use the terminal to run:
     ```bash
     npx prisma db push
     npx prisma db seed
     ```

3. **Option C: Manual Setup**
   - Connect to your database directly
   - Run the SQL commands from the Prisma schema
